# usv_los_path_tracking

In this code we developed a line of sigth path tracking algoritm for otter unmmaned surface vehicle that is developed by maritime robotic so los parameters such as maximum speed, maximum angle error was determinated according to vehicle dynamic.


- "CubicPathGenerator.py" is written by benefit form Fossen's *"Handbook of Marine Craft Hydrodynamics and Motion"* book chapter 10 *Guidance Systems*.

- In "CubicCurve.py", code of Atsuski is modifed, for getting curve coefficient values matrix. 

- R_Calculation.py calculates instant radius of path that a vehicle move across on
